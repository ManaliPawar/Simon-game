# Simon-game

## Features
In this project the buttons flash and the user is to copy the sequence and click the correct button.
You can change the mode from 'medium' to 'hard'.
You can reset the game throughout the game.
I have a counter so the user knows what level they are on throughout the game.
The coloured buttons change positions when you move on the next level in hard mode.
I have used a random function which will allow the game to use a unique sequence each time.
I have used 'start' and 'reset' buttons to let the user have control of the game.

## Technologies Used
JQuery - I have used jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation Bootsrap - I have used bootsrap for icons and effects Font Awesome - I have used font awesome to add some different font onto my website. CSS - For styling the game HTML - For the elements of the game
